            <p>P-47 Thunderbolt is a World War II-era fighter aircraft produced by the American aerospace company Republic Aviation from 1941 through 1945.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It was one of the main United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) fighters of World War II, and it also served with other Allied air forces, including those of France, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. Mexican and Brazilian squadrons fighting alongside the USAAF also flew the P-47.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the spring of 1940, Republic and the USAAC concluded that the XP-44 and the XP-47 were inferior to Luftwaffe fighters. Republic tried to improve the design, proposing the XP-47A but this failed. Kartveli then designed a much larger fighter, which was offered to the USAAC in June 1940. The Air Corps ordered a prototype in September as the XP-47B.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The XP-47B first flew on 6 May 1941 with Lowry P. Brabham at the controls. The prototype had achieved a level speed of 412 mph (663 km/h) at 25,800 ft (7,864 m) altitude and had demonstrated a climb from sea level to 15,000 ft (4,600 m) in five minutes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The newly reorganized United States Army Air Forces placed an order for 171 production aircraft, the first being delivered in December 1941.</p>

        <div class="design">
            <p>The P-47 was designed by Alexander Kartveli, around the powerful Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp engine, which was also used by two U.S. Navy/U.S. Marine Corps fighter planes, the Grumman F6F Hellcat and the Vought F4U Corsair.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The XP-47B, an imrpoved version of the original, was of all-metal construction with elliptical wings, with a straight leading edge that was slightly swept back. The air-conditioned cockpit was roomy and the pilot's seat was comfortable.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Its armament, four Browning AN/M2  .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns on each wing, and frequently two 500lb bombs or later 6 HVAR rockets, made it significantly effective on both air-to-air and air-to-ground warfare.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It was very heavy compared with contemporary single-engined fighters, 65% more than the YP-43. Kartveli said, "It will be a dinosaur, but it will be a dinosaur with good proportions".</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Thunderbolt was effective as a short-to medium-range escort fighter in high-altitude air-to-air combat and ground attack in both the European and Pacific theaters.</p>
